# Salmonella Enterica Pathogen Detection :microscope:

This repository contains an analysis of pathogen detection data for Salmonella Enterica using DNA sequencing technology. The analysis includes data preprocessing, exploration, visualization, and machine learning modeling.

## About :dna:

Advances in DNA sequencing technology have made it possible for scientists to rapidly sequence complete microbial genomes. This has enabled the detection and analysis of microbial pathogens at the molecular level.

## Dataset :bar_chart:

The dataset used in this analysis includes genomic sequences of Salmonella Enterica, along with information about isolation sources, serovars, antimicrobial resistance genotypes, and more.

## Analysis :chart_with_upwards_trend:

The analysis includes the following steps:

1. Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the dataset for analysis.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis: Visualizing and exploring trends in the data.
3. Time Series Analysis: Analyzing the number of samples collected over time.
4. SNP Cluster Analysis: Analyzing the distribution of SNP clusters.
5. Machine Learning: Creating a Random Forest model to predict antimicrobial resistance genotypes.
